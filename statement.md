# Project Statement: VIT Door-to-Door Delivery Service

## 1. Problem Statement
Students residing in our Boy's Hostel often face inconvenience when purchasing daily essentials—such as late-night snacks, study materials, or sports equipment—without leaving their hostel blocks. A lack of streamlined interface causes inconvenience to students by disrupting their studies/leisure time. This project bridges that gap by providing a digital ordering interface.

## 2. Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is to develop a CLI application that facilitates the ordering and delivery process within the campus.
    * Selection of items across three major categories: Sports, Study Materials, and Food/Beverages.
    * Automated calculation of total costs including a fixed campus delivery fee.
    * Validation of delivery locations restricted to specific hostel blocks (1-8).

## 3. Target Users
* **Primary Users:** Students residing in the VIT Boy's Hostel who require quick delivery of goods.

## 4. High-Level Features
* **Item Cataloging:** Users can view a list of available categories (Sports, Study, Beverages, Snacks).
* **Automatic Cost Calculation:** The system automatically calculates the total price based on user-input quantity and unit price, along with a standard delivery surcharge.
* **Input Validation:** The system enforces input validation to ensure orders are only accepted for valid blocks (1-8) and ensuring data integrity (preventing negative prices or quantities).
* **Order Summary:** Generates a final confirmation with the total amount due and delivery confirmation.
